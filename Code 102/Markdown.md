# Markdown

## Welcome to the Markdown FAQ

### Q: What is Markdown?

A: Quick way to add style to a webpage without using HTML/CSS.

### Q: Why do we use Markdown?

A: It doesn't require a coding skill; anyone can quickly pick this up and use it to make a webpage.

### Q: What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

A: To create a heading, you will use the # symbol before the text and include a space.

`Ex: # Heading`

### Q: How many symbols do you need to create the largest heading? And how many symbols are needed for the smallest heading?

A: Heading sizes range between x1 # and x6 #. To make the largest you will use 1 x # (#). The smallest uses 6 x # (######).

Ex: # Huge Heading
Ex: ###### Tiny Heading

### Q: When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

A: * or _ symbols when making text bold or italicized. To start, take the text that you want to make bold, and wrap the text in either symbol `*` or `_`. Bold uses double the symbols, while italicized uses single symbols. Place the symbol(s) in front and back on the text you want to be affected. Here's the shortcut for Mac and Windows: Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows). For italicization: Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows)

### **Bold**

Ex: **This text is Bold**
Ex: __This text is Bold__

### *Italicized*

Ex: *This text is Italicized*
Ex: _This text is Italicized_
  
You can use these two in combination as well by using different symbols for each.

Ex: **This text is bold and _this text is bold and italicized_!**

How it looks:

**This text is bold and *this text is bold and italicized***

### Q: How do you create a link with Markdown?

A: Take the text you want to hyperlink and wrap it in [].

Ex: [GitHub]
    
Put the URL link next to it in (). This makes a link that goes to GitHub and tells the user by the text GitHub that this routs to that site.

Ex: [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Q: What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

A: +, *, or -.
