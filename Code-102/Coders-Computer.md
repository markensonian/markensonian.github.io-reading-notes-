Please see below for answers to questions to Text Editors and the Terminal

### Q: What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

Answer:

1. **Code Completion**

    - Similar to the predictive text that you see in emails and text messages. As you start to type you can press a button
    and it'll complete it. If it doesn't know the exact option a drop-down will appear for you to choose.

2. **Syntax Highlighting**

    - Color codes the different syntax (or set of rules to a language) so that it helps to understand the formatting.

3. **Extensions**

    - More customization of your text editor with useful tools that can alleviate pain points and give assistance while coding.
    This helps with being flexible while coding.

4. **Themes**

    - You avoid eye strain when a dark mode is available.
