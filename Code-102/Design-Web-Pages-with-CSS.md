# Design Web Pages with CSS

## What's CSS?

Language for specifying how a site should look to a user. This refers to color, layout, style, and so on as it's part of web design. CSS is a rule-based language and the maker makes the rules and styles used on that page. CSS properties have different values depending on what the builder wants to use. " color" and " font size" are some rules for CSS. The maker can change the background and borders of a site to show different spacing around a specific group of photos or text. 

## How to add CSS

External CSS changes the site's look with just one file in a CSS extension.
Internal CSS style sheets are CSS formatted inside the HTML code.
Inline CSS can be put into the tag. Cascading order for the style sheets is inline, external and internal style, and browser default.
