## Answer These Questions

What is an expression in JavaScript?

Valid unit of code that resolves to a value. e.g. x = 7. 3 + 4. const z = 3 + 4.

2. Why would we use a loop in our code?

They have a fast and easy way to repeat something in code e.g.

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log("Walking east one step");
}

3. When does a for loop stop executing?

When a specified condition evaluates to false.

4. How many times will a while loop execute?

As long as its specified condition evaluates to true e.g. 

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
} executes as long as n < 3.
