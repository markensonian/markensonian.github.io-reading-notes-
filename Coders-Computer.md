## Welcome to the Coder's FAQ: Text Editor & The Terminal

Please see below for answers to questions to Text Editors and the Terminal

### Q: What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

Answer:

1. **Code Completion**

    - Similar to the predictive text that you see in emails and text messages. As you start to type you can press a button
    and it'll complete it. If it doesn't know the exact option a drop-down will appear for you to choose.

2. **Syntax Highlighting**

    - Color codes the different syntax (or set of rules to a language) so that it helps to understand the formatting.

3. **Extensions**

    - More customization of your text editor with useful tools that can alleviate pain points and give assistance while coding.
    This helps with being flexible while coding.

4. **Themes**

    - You avoid eye strain when a dark mode is available.

### Q: What do the following commands do?

Answer:

1. pwd=Print Working Directory

    - Tells what directory (or folder) you're in.

2. ls=list

    - Lists everything in your directory.
    - Go to the directory you want to inspect and enter ls.

3. cd=Change Directory

    - Allows you to move to different directories.
    - To do this, write `cd <directory>` Replace what's between <> with the directory you want to change to.

4. mkdir=Make Directory
- Makes new folders
    - To do this, write `mkdir <FolderName>` and replace what's between <> with the directory you want to create.

5. touch=Create a File

    - Makes new files. Add file extensions (ex: .txt, .doc, .pdf, etc)

### Q: Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

Answer:

1. cd projects

    - Changes the directory (cd) to the projects folder.

2. mkdir new-project

    - Makes (mkdir) a new directory that's named new-project.

3. touch new-project/newfile.md

    - Makes (touch) a new file (newfile.md) in the folder new-project.
    - Goes to that directory (new-project) and makes the new file (newfile.md).

4. cd ..

    - Changes directories by going back to the previous folder.
    - Changes with x1 . stays in the same directory, x2 .. goes back one, etc.

5. ls projects/new-project

    - Lists (ls) everything in the folder (new-project) by moving/changing directories through the path projects -> new-project.
