# Welcome to Growth Mindset

In the words of Taylor Swift, "You are not your mistakes. You are not damaged goods or money from your failed explorations. You are not the opinion of someone who doesn’t know you. You are a product of the lessons that you’ve learned."

## Growth Mindset

1. What is Growth Mindset?
   - It is the opposite of a fixed mindset that implies failure to reach goals due to thinking that success comes from certain 'fixed' traits e.g. intelligence stays the same and does not improve.
   - Embrace challenges, no pain, no gain, handle feedback well, get inspired by others, and succeed.

2. What are 3 reminders to help stay in a growth mindset?
   - Feedback - As Bill Gates said, "It is more important to heed the lessons of failure."
   - Love Learning - Henry Ford said, “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.”
   - Challenge - When things get easy, try something new to make a change and grow.
