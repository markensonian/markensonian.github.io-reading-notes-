### Q: When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

A: * or _ symbols when making text bold or italicized. To start, take the text that you want to make bold, wrap text in either symbol `*` or `_`. Bold uses double the symbols, while italicised uses single symbols. Place the symbol(s) in front and back on text you want affected.

### **Bold**

    Ex: **This text is Bold**
    Ex: __This text is Bold__

### *Italicized*

    Ex: *This text is Italicized*
    Ex: _This text is Italicized_
  
You can use these two in combination as well by using different symbols for each.

    Ex: **This text is bold and _this text is bold and italicized_!**

How it appears:

**This text is bold and *this text is bold and italicized***
