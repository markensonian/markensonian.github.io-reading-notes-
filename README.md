## About Me

**My name is Markenson Delkhaste. I am based out of LA, CA.** :us:

Check out my portfolio [_here_](https://github.com/markensonian).

- I grew up in LA for the most part.
- I have made a few video games and like journaling and hope to get my first paid job or internship this year at Disneyland if not elsewhere. 
- I began to learn programming through self-study and school starting my last year of high school and then I took a hiatus.
- In 2023, I'm taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to reinforce my knowledge and potentially learn more.

## Purpose of this Website

This site is used to take Code 102. I'll be using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. See the Table of Contents for pages.
