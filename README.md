Welcome to my **Reading Notes**

## About Me

**My name is Markenson Delkhaste, a student. I'm based in LA, CA.**

Look at my portfolio [_here_](https://github.com/markensonian).

- I grew up in LA for the most part.
- I have made a few video games and like journaling and hope to get my first paid job or internship this year at Disneyland if not elsewhere. 
- I began to learn programming through self-study and school starting my last year of high school and then I took a hiatus.
- In 2023, I'm taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to reinforce my knowledge and potentially learn more.

## Purpose of this Website

This site is used to take Code 102. I'll be using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. See the Table of Contents for pages. Later, there'll be more sites for more courses.
